master branch is a label that git creates for us when we init. a repository.

head is another label that git creates for us when we create our first commit. It is not a branch.

#creates a new branch (label) called git-notes
git branch git-notes

#shows us which branch is active
git branch

Github is the hub of .git/ directories

You can push and pull commits to and from .git/ directories

you can also clone .git/ directories to new computers or new paths

Pull requests are how you merge branches on GitHub
